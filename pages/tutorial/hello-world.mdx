# Welcome to the Chakra tutorial! ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Chakra UI library in a project.
We will have a look at our core features and components.

## Code along

To make it easier for you to get started and focus on the content, we've built
an interactive step by step guide in each section. You will be able to code
along the tutorial without opening an IDE. You will come across buttons with
code actions to help you. This could look like this:

Open your <TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/App.tsx' /> file.

You will also find code blocks with step by step examples. You can copy the code
to the codesandbox by clicking on the top right button in the codeblock. Like
this you focus more on the conten and less on the typing. Try it out:

```tsx path=/App.tsx type=tutorial
import { Center, ChakraProvider, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Center h='100vh'>
        <Heading>Hello World</Heading>
      </Center>
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> Copying the code from codeblocks always replaces the complete code in the file
> of codesandbox

<TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/package.json' />
<TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/App.tsx' />
<TutorialFileAction type='add' path='/Test.tsx' />
<TutorialFileAction type='delete' path='/Test.tsx' />
