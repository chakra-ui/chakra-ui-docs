description: Tools to help create your dynamic custom theme
---

The Theme Tools from ChakraUI are a collection of utilities that are for public
use to simplify your custom theme file with functions to make it more dynamic.

<ComponentLinks
  github={{ package: 'theme-tools' }}
  npm={{ package: '@chakra-ui/theme-tools' }}
/>

With any of these tools, you will need to install the `theme-tools` package
separately as they are not a part of `@chakra-ui/react`.

```js
import { ... } from '@chakra-ui/theme-tools'
```

## Usage

All of the tools are used in various places within your theme file. Each example
below comes from the default component themes from ChakraUI. In most cases, they
leverage style props that are passed into a given component to be able to
function correctly.

Take for example a new `Button` variant. We need to access the props by giving a
variant an anonymous function. And then destructure what you need.

Typically, the props you might need are the `theme` object itself and the
`colorScheme` which you pass in as an active color token names (not including
the range values) (see the [default theme colors](../theming/theme#colors))

```js
const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Button: {
      variants: {
        variantCustom: (props) => {
          const { theme, colorScheme: c } = props
          // Some setup logic here
          return {
            // Apply styles here
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Style Function Props

When creating a variant or base style with dynamic styles, it's value can be a
function instead of an object to use props that are passed to the component. The
following props can be used as part of the signature:

| Prop          | Type / Value                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `colorScheme` | string value of a theme token (ie. `blue` or `green`)                      |
| `theme`       | The theme object                                                           |
| `colorMode`   | `Dark` or `Light` depending on the current value in the ColorMode Provider |
| `orientation` | `horizontal` or `vertical` i8n value                                       |

And any other props passed to the component you want to access!

## Colors

Below are the methods that can be used to access and alter the colors from the
theme.

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Function Call                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getColor`           | Retrieves a color hex value. Needs the theme and color name, and can take a fallback hex if the color name does not return a valid hex from the theme.                                                                                                                                               | `getColor(theme, color, fallback)`                                    |
| `tone`               | Determines if the given color is relatively "light" or "dark".

| `isDark` / `isLight` | Utilizes the `tone` method to return a boolean whether a color is "Dark" or "Light".                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `isDark(color)(theme)`                                                |
| `transparentize`     | Returns the given color with an alpha value as an rgba string. Requires the color, opacity in decimals (0 - 1) and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                 | `transparentize(color, opacity)(theme)`                               |
| `whiten`             | Returns a hex value with a whiter shade of the given color. Requires the color, the amount of white (0 - 100) and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                  | `whiten(color, amount)(theme)`                                        |
| `blacken`            | The opposite of `whiten`. Requires the color, the amount of black (0 - 100), and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `blacken(color, amount)(theme)`                                       |
| `darken`             | Similar to `blacken`, but darkens the shade of the given color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `darken(color, amount)(theme)`                                        |

| `contrast`           | Returns the contrast ratio of two provided colors. The first param is the foreground color, and the second the background color. Also requires the theme object.                                                                                                                                     | `contrast(fg, bg)(theme)`                                             |
| `isAccessible`       | Determines if the two given colors meet contrast ratio guidelines. Requires the theme object, the text color as the first param, the background color as the second param, and an optional object of WCAG params (See the [API Docs](https://tinycolor.vercel.app/docs/interfaces/WCAG2Parms.html)). | `isAccessible(textColor, bgColor, options?)(theme)`                   |
| `complementary`      | Provide the complementary color to the provided color. Requires a color and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `complementary(color)(theme)`                                         |
| `generateStripe`     | Creates a set of styles for a gradient background image to use as a divider. Optionally can take a new unit size (height/width) and color.                                                                                                                                                           | `generateStripe(size = "1rem", color = "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)" )` |
| `randomColor`        | Generates a random color. Can optionally take an object with either any string to convert to a hex, or an array of colors to randomly pick                                                                                                                                                           | `randomColor(opts?)`                                                  |

### Examples

Below showcases a mix of the methods in action from Chakra's default component
theme.

We can find a prime use case of `getColor()` in the `Alert` themes, where a
function is created with `mode()` and `transparentize()` theme tool method for
the background color to determine which color to return based on the color mode.

> Mode is discussed later in the [Component Theme Tools](#).

```js
function getBg(props: StyleFunctionProps): string {
  const { theme, colorScheme: c } = props
  const lightBg = getColor(theme, `${c}.100`, c)
  const darkBg = transparentize(`${c}.200`, 0.16)(theme)
  return mode(lightBg, darkBg)(props)
}

const variantSubtle: PartsStyleFunction<typeof parts> = (props) => {
  const { colorScheme: c } = props
  return {
    container: { bg: getBg(props) },
    icon: { color: mode(`${c}.500`, `${c}.200`)(props) },
    spinner: {
      color: mode(`${c}.500`, `${c}.200`)(props),
    },
  }
}
```
