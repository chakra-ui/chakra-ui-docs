The Theme Tools from ChakraUI are a collection of utilities that are for public
use to simplify your custom theme file with functions to make it more dynamic.

<ComponentLinks
  github={{ package: 'theme-tools' }}
  npm={{ package: '@chakra-ui/theme-tools' }}
/>

With any of these tools, you will need to install the `theme-tools` package
separately as they are not a part of `@chakra-ui/react`.

```js
import { ... } from '@chakra-ui/theme-tools'
```

## Usage

All of the tools are used in various places within your theme file. Each example
below comes from the default component themes from ChakraUI. In most cases, they
leverage style props that are passed into a given component to be able to
function correctly.

Take for example a new `Button` variant. We need to access the props by giving a
variant an anonymous function. And then destructure what you need.

Typically, the props you might need are the `theme` object itself and the
`colorScheme` which you pass in the an active color token names (not including
the range values) (see the [default theme colors](../theming/theme#colors))

```js
const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Button: {
      variants: {
        variantCustom: (props) => {
          const { theme, colorScheme: c } = props
          // Some setup logic here
          return {
            // Apply styles here
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```
