description: Tools to help create your dynamic custom theme
---

The Theme Tools from ChakraUI are a collection of utilities that are for public
use to simplify your custom theme file or styling within components using
methods to make your design more dynamic.

<ComponentLinks
  github={{ package: 'theme-tools' }}
  npm={{ package: '@chakra-ui/theme-tools' }}
/>

With any of these tools, you will need to install the `theme-tools` package
separately as they are not a part of `@chakra-ui/react`.

```js
import { ... } from '@chakra-ui/theme-tools'
```

## Usage

All of the tools are used in various places within your theme file. Each example
below comes from the default component themes from ChakraUI. In most cases, they
leverage style props that are passed into a given component to be able to
function correctly.

Take for example a new `Button` variant. We need to access the props by giving a
variant an anonymous function. And then destructure what you need.

Typically, the props you might need are the `theme` object itself and the
`colorScheme` which you pass in as an active color token names (not including
the range values) (see the [default theme colors](../theming/theme#colors))

```js
const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Button: {
      variants: {
        variantCustom: (props) => {
          const { theme, colorScheme: c } = props
          // Some setup logic here
          return {
            // Apply styles here
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

> [scale out your project](../theming/customize-theme#scaling-out-your-project)

## Style Function Props

When creating a variant or base style with dynamic styles, it's value can be a
function instead of an object to use props that are passed to the component. The
following props can be used as part of the signature:

| Prop          | Type / Value                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `colorScheme` | string value of a theme token (ie. `blue` or `green`)                                                          |
| `theme`       | The theme object                                                                                               |
| `colorMode`   | `Dark` or `Light` depending on the current value in the ColorMode Provider                                     |
| `orientation` | `horizontal` or `vertical`, defined as the direction the component is laid out. (Like setting `flexDirection`) |

And any other props passed to the component you want to access!

## Colors

Below are the methods that can be used to access and alter the colors from the
theme.

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Function Call                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getColor`           | Retrieves a color hex value. Needs the theme and color name, and can take a fallback hex if the color name does not return a valid hex from the theme.                                                                                                                                               | `getColor(theme, color, fallback)`                                    |
| `tone`               | Determines if the given color is relatively "light" or "dark". Requires the theme and a color                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `tone(color)(theme)`                                                  |
| `isDark` / `isLight` | Utilizes the `tone` method to return a boolean whether a color is "Dark" or "Light".                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `isDark(color)(theme)`                                                |
| `transparentize`     | Returns the given color with an alpha value as an rgba string. Requires the color, opacity in decimals (0 - 1) and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                 | `transparentize(color, opacity)(theme)`                               |
| `whiten`             | Returns a hex value with a whiter shade of the given color. Requires the color, the amount of white (0 - 100) and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                  | `whiten(color, amount)(theme)`                                        |
| `blacken`            | The opposite of `whiten`. Requires the color, the amount of black (0 - 100), and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `blacken(color, amount)(theme)`                                       |
| `darken`             | Similar to `blacken`, but darkens the shade of the given color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `darken(color, amount)(theme)`                                        |

| `contrast`           | Returns the contrast ratio of two provided colors. The first param is the foreground color, and the second the background color. Also requires the theme object.                                                                                                                                     | `contrast(fg, bg)(theme)`                                             |
| `isAccessible`       | Determines if the two given colors meet contrast ratio guidelines. Requires the theme object, the text color as the first param, the background color as the second param, and an optional object of WCAG params (See the [API Docs](https://tinycolor.vercel.app/docs/interfaces/WCAG2Parms.html)). | `isAccessible(textColor, bgColor, options?)(theme)`                   |
| `complementary`      | Provide the complementary color to the provided color. Requires a color and the theme object.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `complementary(color)(theme)`                                         |
| `generateStripe`     | Creates a set of styles for a gradient background image to use as a divider. Optionally can take a new unit size (height/width) and color.                                                                                                                                                           | `generateStripe(size = "1rem", color = "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)" )` |
| `randomColor`        | Generates a random color. Can optionally take an object with either any string to convert to a hex, or an array of colors to randomly pick                                                                                                                                                           | `randomColor(opts?)`                                                  |

### Color Tool Examples

Below showcases a mix of the methods in action from Chakra's default component
theme.

We can find a prime use case of `getColor()` in the `Alert` themes, where a
function is created with `mode()` and `transparentize()` theme tool method for
the background color to determine which color to return based on the color mode.

> Mode is discussed later in the [Component Theme Tools](#component-tools).

```ts
function getBg(props: StyleFunctionProps): string {
  const { theme, colorScheme: c } = props
  const lightBg = getColor(theme, `${c}.100`, c)
  const darkBg = transparentize(`${c}.200`, 0.16)(theme)
  return mode(lightBg, darkBg)(props)
}

const variantSubtle: PartsStyleFunction<typeof parts> = (props) => {
  const { colorScheme: c } = props
  return {
    container: { bg: getBg(props) },
    icon: { color: mode(`${c}.500`, `${c}.200`)(props) },
    spinner: {
      color: mode(`${c}.500`, `${c}.200`)(props),
    },
  }
}
```

## Component Tools

There are mny times where you need the theme to be reliant on the color mode
and/or the direction a component is rendered (horizontally or vertically).

### `mode()`

A function that accepts two values and requires the props object from the
component theme (variant or base style) to check for color mode. Then returns
either the first value if in "light" mode or the second if in "dark" mode.

> You can [see the example above](#color-tool-examples) with the `getBg`
> function which returns this method and applied to any instance of a
> `background` prop.

### `orient`

A function that returns an object of declared styles depending on orientation
value ("horizontal" or "vertical").

It is used both in themes and in components or component hooks to obtain
orientation state for the most dynamic styling possible.

The example below spreads the `orient` return into a
[`markerStyle` object](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/main/packages/slider/src/use-slider.ts#L470-L484)
that is used for the marker of the `Slider` component. So if the `orientation`
value provided is "vertical", then the styling declared in the "vertical" object
is returned.

```ts
const markerStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
  position: 'absolute',
  pointerEvents: 'none',
  ...orient({
    orientation,
    vertical: {
      bottom: isReversed ? `${100 - markerPercent}%` : `${markerPercent}%`,
    },
    horizontal: {
      left: isReversed ? `${100 - markerPercent}%` : `${markerPercent}%`,
    },
  }),
}
```

## CSS tools

### `cssCalc`

This is a collection of methods used to create the CSS `calc()` function based
on number value passed in. The collection is imported as `calc` followed by the
method name.

For example: `calc.add(10, 20)` will return `calc(10 + 20)`

In addition to methods that create `calc()`, there is also the `negate` method
which return the value multiplied by -1. If a string is passed in such as
`"5 + 8"`, then the value returned is `-5 + 8`. If it's an actual operation and
not a string, such as `calc.negate(5 + 8)`, then the value returned is `-13`.

### `cssVar`

Method to generate a prefixed CSS variable and reference `var()` function.

```js
cssVar('custom-component', 'blue', 'chakra')

/*
 * Returns the object
 * {
 *   variable: `--chakra-custom-component`,
 *   reference: `var(--chakra-custom-component, blue)`
 * }
 */
```

> In the `reference` object property, since the second argument `fallback` is
> provided, then the `var()` function is called with the fallback value as its
> second argument, in this case "blue".

The example below comes from the `Switch` component default theme, which
utilizes both tools to help create the initial setup of the base styles.

> Note that `negate()` is extended with a `toString` to make the value valid in
> the object because the argument of `$diff` is supplied to `calc` which passes
> it down to the method.

```ts
const $width = cssVar('switch-track-width')
const $height = cssVar('switch-track-height')

const $diff = cssVar('switch-track-diff')
const diffValue = calc.subtract($width, $height)

const $translateX = cssVar('switch-thumb-x')

// Later in the file...

const baseStyle: PartsStyleFunction<typeof parts> = (props) => ({
  container: {
    [$diff.variable]: diffValue,
    [$translateX.variable]: $diff.reference,
    _rtl: {
      [$translateX.variable]: calc($diff).negate().toString(),
    },
  },
  track: baseStyleTrack(props),
  thumb: baseStyleThumb,
})
```
