## Watch the Egghead Course

Hello and welcome to Chakra UI 😄. If you're new here, watch our free course
below.

## Framework Guide

Whichever framework or tool you're using, we've put together step-by-step guides
to get you up and running with Chakra UI.

<FrameworkLinks />

## Direct integrations

If you're working without any of the frameworks above, install Chakra UI using
the steps below

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install Chakra UI by running either of the
following:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^5
```

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react@^11 @emotion/styled@^11 framer-motion@^5
```

### Set up Provider

For Chakra UI to work correctly, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the
root of your application.

Go to the root of your application and do this:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App({ Component }) {
  // 2. Use at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Component />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

## Use our Create-React-App Templates

> - For Create React App, you need to set this up in `index.js` or `index.tsx`

See [the guide for our create-react-app](/guides/integrations/with-cra)
templates if you'd like to generate a Chakra-enabled `create-react-app` project
from scratch.
