`@chakra-ui/react@1.6.1`

**Popover** `v1.7.0`

- Add an export for `usePopoverContext` hook.

**Transition** `v1.3.0`

- Add support for tweaking the enter-exit transitions. Affected components:
  `Fade`, `Slide`, `SlideFade`, `SlideScale`, `Collapse`.

```jsx live=false
<Fade
  transition={{
    enter: { duration: 0.3 },
    exit: { duration: 0.1 },
  }}
/>
```

- Fix issue where `Collapse` animation hide overflow when it expands. Collapse
  transition how shows overflow when it's expanded and hides overflow when it's
  collapsed.

- Add support for `delay` prop for all transition components.

```jsx live=false
// as a number
<Fade delay={0.3} />

// or based on state (enter/exit only)
<Fade delay={{ enter: 0.2 }} />

// or both
<Fade delay={{ enter: 0.2, exit: 0.1 }} />
```

Note: this only works when you're using our built-in transition definition. If
you're passing your own transition definition, pass the delay there.

```jsx live=false
// adding delay to your custom transition definition
<Fade
  transition={{
    enter: { duration: 0.2, delay: 0.1 },
  }}
/>
```
