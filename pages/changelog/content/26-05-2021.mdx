`@chakra-ui/react@1.6.3`

**Popper** `v2.2.0`

The `popper.js` instance will not be created until the `enabled` option is
`true`. This improves the render and scroll performance when you use many
popper-related items.

Affected components: Menu, Popover and Tooltip components

**Media Query** `v1.0.14` Fix issue where `useMediaQuery` does not work as
expected when use within an `iframe`. The hook now references the correct
`ownerDocument`

**Styled System** `v1.6.7`

- Fix boolean condition affecting `bgImage` url
- Fix import type issues caused by the `WithCSSVar` type
