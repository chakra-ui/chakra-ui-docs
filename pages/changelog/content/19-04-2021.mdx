`@chakra-ui/react@1.5.2`

**Button** `v1.3.0`

- Added `spinnerPlacement` prop to allow changing the spinner placement for the
  button when `isLoading` is `true`. Spinner placement can be either `start` or
  `end`.

```jsx live=false
<Button isLoading spinnerPlacement="end">
  Click me
</Button>
```

**Checkbox** `v1.5.0`

- Add `isDisabled` prop to `CheckboxGroup`.

**Hooks** `v1.5.0`

- Add pan session hook `usePanGesture` for detecting pan gestures.
- Update `useLatestRef` to inline value updates. Not concurrent mode safe but
  works for now.
- Add `useEventListenerMap` to provide an elegant way of attaching several
  pointer event to the `document` or an element.

**Menu** `v1.5.0` & **Popover** `v1.6.0` & **Tabs** `v1.4.0`

- This change restores the behavior of the `isLazy` prop (which was broken by
  the previous release) and adds a new `lazyBehavior` prop which configures the
  behavior of `isLazy`.

If you'd like the content of tab panel, popover and menu components to be
unmounted when not selected or opened, please continue to use `isLazy`. This is
the default behavior.

If you'd like the content of tab panel, popover and menu components to remain
mounted (but hidden) after it was previously selected or opened, use
`lazyBehavior="keepMounted"` in combination with `isLazy`.

**Utils** `v1.6.0`

- Add lazy content utility for disclosure components like popover, menu, tab,
  etc.
- Add pan session class to handle pan gestures. This is used in the slider logic
  and sharable with vue library.
- Perfomance: Throttle pan move events to once per frame which improves the
  slider's `onChange` call performance.
- Update types for internal pointer event.

**React Env** `v1.0.2`

- Fix bug where `EnvProvider` breaks SSR.

**Modal** `v1.8.3` & **Theme** `v1.8.3`

- Fixed an issue where the modal exceeded the viewport height on iOS.

**Slider** `v1.2.3`

- Fix issue where slider doesnt work after first slide.
- Avoid exccess `onChange` calls.

**Stat** `v1.1.7`

- Fixed a11y issue related to `StatHelpText`. It was using an invalid `dl` child
  tag.

**Styled System** `v1.10.3`
