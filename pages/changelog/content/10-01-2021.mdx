`@chakra-ui/react@1.1.3`

**Styled System** `v1.4.0`

- Fixed a bug where `rgb` values in `bgGradient` did not work correctly
- Due to Safari not support css logical properties for `right`, and `left`, we
  added polyfill for these css logical properties.
- Add support for css media query and dark class selectors.

**Theme** `v1.4.0`

- Add the `2xl` breakpoint to the theme which maps to `96em` or `1536px`.

**Media Query** `v1.0.3`

- Fixed `useBreakpoinValue` infinite loop due to bug in `createMediaQueries`.

**Portal** `v1.0.3`

- Fixed issue where elements within portal used in an iframe got rendered
  outside of the iframe. Portal now smartly detects its document owner and
  attaches its node to the correct document.body
- Removed extra DOM node `PortalManager` creates. Less is more!

**Skeleton** `v1.0.7`

- Fixed a bug where SkeletonText kept its fixed dimensions when isLoaded is
  true.

**Tabs** `v1.0.4`

- Fixed issue where Tab button no longer has `aria-selected="false"` when it is
  inactive.
