`@chakra-ui/react@1.4.2`

**Accordion** `v1.2.0`

- Extract all react based utilities and types to `@chakra-ui/react-utils`.

**Avatar** `v1.2.0`

- Fix RTL styles.

**Checkbox** `v1.4.0`

- Add `getRootProps` to `useCheckbox` hook to manage props passed to checkbox
  container.

- Forward `onFocus`, `onBlur` and `aria-\*` props to the input element for
  better integration with form libraries.

- Ensure the checkbox works when the root element is not label. This helps to
  fix the current accessibility issues with the Switch component when wrapped
  within `FormControl`.

**Counter** `v1.1.0`

- Expose `setValue` function to allow update state without calling `onChange`.
- Fix issue where `onChange` is called when value did not change.

**Form Control** `v1.3.0`

- Refactor `useFormControlProvider` to return prop getters `getHelpTextProps`,
  `getErrorMessageProps`, and `getRootProps`.

- Detect helper text and error message using ref callback instead of
  `useLayoutEffect`.

- Update `aria-describedby` id to include feedbackId only when `isInvalid` is
  true.

- Create `useFormControlProps` to provide a way to get the resolved form control
  props `isInvalid`, `isDisabled`, instead of HTML attributes. This will make it
  easier to integrate with number-input, checkbox, and switch.
- Fix concurrent mode issue with setting state in focus event handler. We use
  withFlushSync helper to achieve this.

**Hooks** `v1.3.0`

- useControllableState: The onChange callback will be called only if the new
  value isn't equal to the current one.

**Layout** `v1.4.0`

- Remove redundant role attribute from divider.
- Fixed the bug where a margin- bottom would get applied to `direction=row `of
  stack when using responsive props.

- Fix issue where AbsoluteCenter doesn't have `position: absolute`.

**Number Input** `v1.2.0`

- Forward `aria-\*` props to the input element.

- Fix issue where `onChange` was called on mount.
- Fix issue where `onBlur` was called twice.
- Memoize all callback props `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `getAriaValueText`.
- Refactor implicit `useFormControl` logic to be called from NumberInput
  instead.

- Call `setFocused.on` with `ReactDOM.flushSync` to prevent concurrent mode
  issue where setting state in onFocus affects onChange event handler.

**Styled System** `v1.1.0`

- Add support for css variable tokens. This means you can create a css variable
  and reference value in the tokens.

```jsx live=false
<Box
  sx={{
    "--banner-color": "colors.red.200",
    "& .banner": {
      bg: "var(--banner-color)",
    },
  }}
/>
```

**System** `v1.6.0`

- Fixed an issue where the `StylesProvider` export was not working in every
  environment.

- Add style config for upcoming `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` style
  props.

**Theme** `v1.8.0`

- Remove 0 token value from spacing tokens. 0 maps to 0 and there's no need to
  create a css custom property for that.

**Switch**

- Add container part
- Use css vars to handle styles
- Fix RTL styles

**Stat, Table**

- Fix RTL styles

**Utils** `v1.5.0`

- Add `withFlushSync` function wrapper to help resolve concurrent mode and
  onFocus state issues.

**Toast** `v1.2.1`

- Bump `@reach/alert` to fix yarn pnp issue.
