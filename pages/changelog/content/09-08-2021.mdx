`@chakra-ui/react@1.6.6`

**Form Control** `v1.4.0`

- Added a `container` part to the `FormControl` component theme, allowing the
  root FormControl element to be themed.

```jsx live=false
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Form: {
      variants: {
        // create a variant named "custom"
        custom: {
          // style the root `FormControl` element
          container: {
            color: "white",
            bg: "blue.900",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

- Remove code that was added as a workaround for pre-releases of React
  concurrent mode.

- If an `aria-describedby` property is passed it will be joined with the id's
  from helper text and error message instead of being overwritten.

**Theme** `v1.10.0`

- Added a container part to the FormControl component theme, allowing the root
  FormControl element to be themed.

- Fixed issue where modals with `size=full` have vertical margins.

**Button** `v1.4.2`

Resolved an issue where a `Button` in loading state didn't consider the width of
`leftIcon` and `rightIcon`, resulting in layout shifts when the button leaves
the loading state. Buttons now render with the same width regardless of state.

**Checkbox** `v1.5.5`

Remove code that was added as a workaround for pre-releases of React concurrent
mode.

**Layout** `v1.4.8`

**Stack**: Ensure that when cloning children, their provided keys are preferred
over index. This prevents them from being destroyed and recreated when a child's
position in the list changes.

**Menu** `v1.7.2`

MenuList scroll to next MenuItem on keyboard navigation when there is a defined
maxHeight on MenuList.

Fix issues when rendering chakra components in different window

**NumberInput** `v1.2.9`

Remove code that was added as a workaround for pre-releases of React concurrent
mode.

**Radio** `v1.3.9`

Remove code that was added as a workaround for pre-releases of React concurrent
mode.

**Slider** `v1.2.8`

Fix issue where slider thumb doesn't show active state in firefox

**Stat** `v1.1.12`

Add container part to Stat styleConfig

**Styled System** `v1.12.2`

- Corrected `parseGradient` function so that it checks for CSS functions.
  Previously, using the CSS calc function would result in invalid CSS being
  generated. The expectation is that:

```jsx live=false
<Heading bgGradient="linear(to-r, green.200, pink.500 calc(20px + 20px))">
  Chakra-UI: Create accessible React apps with speed
</Heading>
functions similar to linear-gradient which handles using a CSS function

<Heading
  bgImage="linear-gradient(
    to right,
    var(--chakra-colors-green-200)),
    var(--chakra-colors-pink-500 calc(20px + 20px))"
>
  Chakra-UI: Create accessible React apps with speed
</Heading>
```

- Grid props type definitions now correctly reflect the implemented behavior in
  regard to tokens.

**System** `v1.7.2`

Fix type definitions for `apply` prop. The `apply` prop supports responsive
styles:

```jsx live=false
// Before: type error, expects `string` for `apply`
<Text apply={{ sm: 'styles.h3', lg: 'styles.h4' }}>

// After: no type error, expects `ResponsiveValue<string>` for `apply`
<Text apply={{ sm: 'styles.h3', lg: 'styles.h4' }}>
```

**Tooltip** `v1.3.9`

Fix tooltips not closing when `openDelay` is set

**Utils** `v1.8.2`

- Remove code that was added as a workaround for pre-releases of React
  concurrent mode.
- Fix issues when rendering chakra components in different window
