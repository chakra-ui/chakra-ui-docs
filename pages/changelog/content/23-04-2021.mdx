`@chakra-ui/react@1.6.0`

**Gatsby Plugin** `v2.0.0`

- Upgrading to this new major version is recommended for everyone as it fixes
  hot reloading in Gatsby (Fast Refresh). In the previous version changes to the
  shadowed theme.js file didn't trigger automatic reloading, and a manual reload
  was necessary.

- The `isUsingColorMode` option was removed. The `ChakraProvider` will always
  use the `ColorModeProvider`.
- The `isResettingCSS` option was renamed to `resetCSS`. Those changes were made
  to use the current ChakraProvider and align the prop names.

Improvements

- Use `ChakraProvider` instead of the outdated `ThemeProvider` pattern.
- Add `initialColorMode` to the `ColorModeScript`.
- Allow Fast Refresh reloading of all theme files.
- Set stricter `peerDependency` on `gatsby` (to ^2.29.3 || ^3.0.0).

**Accordion** `v1.3.0`

- Update tabs and accordion to use updated descendants logic.

**Menu** `v1.6.0`

- Update menu to use new descendants logic.
- Fix issue where menu doesn't select menu item when the first item is disabled.
- Fix issue where menu doesn't work when an input is used within it.
- Fix issue where menu button doesn't work with truncated text.

**Pin Input** `v1.6.0`

- Update pin-input to use the new descendants logic.

**React** `v1.6.0` & **Theme** `v1.8.4`

- The `extendTheme` function allows you to pass multiple overrides or
  extensions:

```jsx live=false
import {
  extendTheme,
  withDefaultColorScheme,
  withDefaultSize,
  withDefaultVariant,
  withDefaultProps,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"

const customTheme = extendTheme(
  {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        // ...
        500: "#b4d455",
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
  withDefaultColorScheme({ colorScheme: "brand" }),
  withDefaultSize({
    size: "lg",
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  withDefaultVariant({
    variant: "outline",
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  // or all in one:
  withDefaultProps({
    defaultProps: {
      colorScheme: "brand",
      variant: "outline",
      size: "lg",
    },
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  // optional:
  yourCustomBaseTheme, // defaults to our chakra default theme
)
```

**Tabs** `v1.5.0`

- Update tabs and accordion to use updated descendants logic.
- Add support for RTL keyboard navigation.

**Utils** `v1.7.0`

- Add `pipe` function.
- Add generic to `isFunction` guard.

**Button** `v1.3.1`

- Resolved an issue where the `type` prop of the `Button` component was set to
  `undefined`.

**Progress** `v1.1.8`

- Fix hyperlink to docs.

- Update types for `mergeRefs` to include null.

  made in PR #3841. The "Providers" section from the Gatsby guide was removed as
  the plugin itself handles everything already.
