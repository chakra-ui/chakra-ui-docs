`@chakra-ui/react@1.1.5`

**Popper** `v1.1.0`

- Added enabled property to `usePopper`. Popper won't be updated while it is set
  to false. Menu now uses this option to not update its position while it's
  closed.

**Styled System** `v1.5.0`

- Move `srOnly` prop to styled system props. This will deprecate the need for
  the visually hidden package. Less is more!

```jsx live=false
  // If `true`, hide an element visually without hiding it from screen readers.
  <Box srOnly>Visually hidden</Box>

  // If `focusable`, the sr-only styles will be undone, making the element visible to sighted users as well as screen readers.
  <Box srOnly _active={{ srOnly: "focusable" }}>Visually hidden but shown on focus
  </Box>
```

- Add `polyfill` for inset style prop as the CSS inset doesn't work in Safari
  Add missing style props for grid and flex layouts: gridTemplate, gridRowStart,
  gridRowEnd, flexFlow, clipPath
