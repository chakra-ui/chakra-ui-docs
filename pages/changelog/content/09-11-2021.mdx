`@chakra-ui/react@1.7.0`

Update build system we use from a custom babel cli setup to
[preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges all
files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

**Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you imported
any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach like
`import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

Here's how to resolve it:

```jsx live=false
// Won't work ðŸŽ‡
import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

// Works âœ…
import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
```

If this affected your project, we recommend that you import hooks, functions or
components the way it's shown in the documentation. This will help keep your
project future-proof.

**Color Mode** `v1.3.0`

Fixed color mode behavior priority in the following order:

- If `useSystemColorMode` is `true`, the system's color mode will be used as
  default and we'll fallback to the `initialColorMode` if system color mode
  isn't resolved.

- If `--chakra-ui-color-mode` is defined through e.g. `ColorModeScript` this
  will be used.

- If local storage is used as the `colorModeManager` and a value is defined for
  `chakra-ui-color-mode`, this will be used.

- if `initialColorMode` is set to `system`, the system's color mode will be used
  as default and we'll fallback to the `initialColorMode` if system color mode
  isn't resolved.

- if `initialColorMode` is set to `'light'` or `'dark'`, the corresponding value
  will be used.

**Modal** `v1.10.0`, **Focus Lock** `v1.2.0`

- `react-focus-lock@2.5.1` includes a dependency update of `focus-lock` from
  `0.8.1` -> `0.9.1`. The change in `focus-lock` includes a fix for performance
  in JSDOM: https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock/pull/24

JSDOM is used when testing react components in jest and other unit testing
frameworks. In particular, when used with `@testing-library/react` for
simulating real user input.

Locally tested on an Apple M1 Air using a moderately complex `<Modal>` component
(which contained inputs, `react-hook-form` usage, etc). Before this change:
20,149ms After this change: 2,347ms

Approx. 10x performance increase.

**Select** `v1.2.0`

- Fixed an styling issue where it was not possible to customize the icon spacing
  of the `Select` component.

**Theme** `v1.12.0`

- Fixed an styling issue where it was not possible to customize the icon spacing
  of the `Select` component.

**Slider** `v1.5.0`

- Fixed the bug in `RangeSlider` where an index out of bounds error would occur
  incase of stacked thumbs.
