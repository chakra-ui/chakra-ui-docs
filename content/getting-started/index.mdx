> Version 2 of Chakra UI is only compatible with React 18. If you are still
> needing to use React 17 or earlier, please use
> [version 1 of Chakra UI](https://v1.chakra-ui.com/guides/first-steps).

To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:
<PackageManagers />

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root
of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or
`App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

### ChakraBaseProvider

As of `v2.4.2` there is now the addition of `ChakraBaseProvider`. This is a
minimal version of `ChakraProvider` that only supplies theme tokens and not the
default component theming.

One of the biggest causes of the large initial JS payload is the size of the
component themes. With this approach, you get to apply the theme for just the
component you need by using `extendBaseTheme`.

```jsx live=false
import { ChakraBaseProvider, extendBaseTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'
// `@chakra-ui/theme` is a part of the base install with `@chakra-ui/react`
import chakraTheme from '@chakra-ui/theme'

const { Button } = chakraTheme.components

const theme = extendBaseTheme({
  components: {
    Button,
  },
})

function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraBaseProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraBaseProvider>
  )
}
```

> 🚨 You must use `extendBaseTheme` for this to work
