> Version 2 of Chakra UI is only compatible with React 18. If you are still
> needing to use React 17 or earlier, please use
> [version 1 of Chakra UI](https://v1.chakra-ui.com/guides/first-steps).

To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:
<Tabs my={4}>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>npm</Tab>
    <Tab>yarn</Tab>
    <Tab>pnpm</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels p={0}>
    <TabPanel>
      ```bash 
        npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
      ```
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      ```bash
        yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
      ```
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      ```bash
        pnpm add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
      ```
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root
of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or
`App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```
